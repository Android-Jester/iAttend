# Background of Study
The university is a hub of learning where students and faculty come together to exchange ideas and knowledge. One of the critical resources that universities provide is study facilities, such as libraries, computer labs, and study halls. These facilities are essential for students to succeed academically, but their effective management is critical. An attendance tracking system can help by providing a comprehensive and accurate picture of facility usage, enabling university administrators to make data-driven decisions about resources and how to manage the facility. In this project background, we will explore the need for an innovative attendance tracking system in can be utilized in university study facilities and how the attendance data generated can help determine the usage of the facility.
Traditionally, they have relied on manual methods of tracking attendance, such as sign-in sheets. While these methods can provide some basic information about facility usage, they are often inaccurate, time-consuming, and inefficient. Manual tracking methods can also make it challenging to identify facility usage patterns and make informed resource allocation decisions. As such, there is a need for a more efficient and accurate system for tracking attendance in facilities.
An innovative attendance tracking system can provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of facility usage, allowing university administrators to make data-driven decisions about the facility. Such a system can help identify peak usage times and patterns in facility usage, enabling administrators to make more effective and informed decisions using data.
